# Smart-Agriculture
Hi I made this Data Analytics project in which we analyze the data and predict the crops demand in a particular city/state in upcoming seasons.<br>
<h3>Smart Agriculture:</h3>
Design / develop solutions to boost local agricultural production using smart solutions, data analytics. Solutions should be affordable, easy to deploy, and help farmers realize qualitative advances, and financial benefits.<br>

● Collecting data of past 10-15 years of market demand product ( eg: Tomato,etc)<br>
● Analysis the data and find which product is demand on which month. (For example Tomato is demand in May and June)<br>
● Intimate to the Farmer through app, City A is demand on tomato.<br>
● So farmer can plan the tomato early.<br>
● Sometime farmer will cultivate tomato extra.<br>
● If the product is demanded in the market then the farmer now easily give the product to the market because we predict the product earlier.<br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
● By using the data analysis of the past year. We can predict the demand product on market.<br>
● Make right alert to the farmers early. Make cultivate the crop at right time.<br>
● So no more demand will create.<br>
● Then no more waste will create.<br><br>
